-*-*-Installation Instructions-*-*-

Use the DAT Texture Wizard software on your legal copy of the NTSC 1.02 version of Super 
Smash Bros. Melee. After doing this, right-click on the first item (root) and "import multiple files", then
import all files from the MeleeReimaginedFiles folder. Save the result as an ISO and you should be able to play
Melee Reimagined.

-*-*-Credits-*-*-

This mod is built on top of PKFreeZZy's mod, Melee Revision 3. Without him MeleeReimagined would not have been possible.

-*-*-Known Issues-*-*-

Some interactions and attacks cause warnings in most emulators, but these do not impact the stability of the game.
To play Melee Reimagined without being interrupted, it is advised to turn these warnings off. For Dolphin, turn off
Panic Handlers in the Configuration/Interface menu.
