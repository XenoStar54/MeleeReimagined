-*-*-Installation Instructions-*-*-

Use the Melee Code Manager app to patch the attached DOL file to your legal copy of the NTSC 1.02 version of Super 
Smash Bros. Melee. After doing this, you should be able to run Melee Reimagined on your device. 

-*-*-Known Issues-*-*-

Some interactions and attacks cause warnings in most emulators, but these do not impact the stability of the game.
To play Melee Reimagined without being interrupted, it is advised to turn these warnings off. For Dolphin, turn off
Panic Handlers in the Configuration/Interface menu.

Tournament mode crashes the game when selected. Do not try to use it in the current build.
