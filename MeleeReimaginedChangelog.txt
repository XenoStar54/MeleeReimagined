***Characters***

**Bowser**

+ Bowser can now mash for significantly more height with Up-B.
+ Flame Cancel ability restored to v1.00 state.

**Captain Falcon**

+ Multijab removed, making gentleman execution much simpler.
+ Raptor Boost now enters fall instead of fall special.
+ Side-B now snaps to ledge. When hit in the air, aerial Side-B also gives Captain Falcon greater control afterwards.
+ Up-B can now be B-reversed by holding the control stick in the opposite direction.
+ Down-B now speeds up instead of slowing down on contact with enemies. Ending lag reduced slightly.

**Donkey Kong**

+ Tie hurtbox removed.
+ Charged Neutral-B is no longer lost when hit out of Up-B. Neutral-B also no longer puts DK into freefall when used in midair.
+ Down-B can be extended by just holding the B button instead of mashing.

**Dr. Mario**

+ Weight increased from 100 to 102.

**Falco**

+ Falco can now hold the B button to continue firing lasers with Neutral-B.

**Fox**

+ Fox can now hold the B button to continue firing lasers with Neutral-B.

**Ganondorf**

= U-Smash changed to an uppercut move rather than being cloned from Captain Falcon. Reuses Up-Throw animation.
+ N-Air now properly links the first hit into the second. Hitbox sizes increased slightly. Foot sweetspot does slightly more damage.
+ Neutral-B now allows Ganondorf to float for a short while. Uses the Ganon Float code by UnclePunch.
+ Side-B now snaps to ledge. It now sends opponents straight down when used on the ground (usually setting up a tech chase scenario), akin to Flame Choke, allowing for some followups. The aerial version also meteors opponents, and also has its landing lag on a successful hit reduced to 10 frames from 40. Miss gravity 0.05 -> 0.55, seemingly allowing for quicker descent after the move ends.

**Ice Climbers**

= Added a HUD element for Nana's damage percentage.
+ Implemented a bug fix for Nana's directional inputs.
+ Both climbers can now share the ledge.
+ Side-B can now gain height by holding the button rather than mashing.
+ Up-B used by just Popo now gives additional height.

**Jigglypuff**

+ U-Smash hitbox IDs changed to allow the sweetspot to actually hit. Sweetspot given slightly boosted knockback.
+ Up-B hits last for slightly longer (frame data matches Ultimate).

**Kirby**

+ Taunting without an ability now grants an ability.
+ Throws are no longer escapable. Additionally, Kirby can now jump after using U-Throw or F-Throw.
+ Like other characters, charged Neutral-B copy abilities are no longer lost when hit out of other special moves.
+ Dash-Attack no longer falls off ledges. 
+ N-Air fixed to allow hitting the strong hitbox at the beginning of the move. Hitbox size increased slightly.

**Link**

- N-Air collisions terminated properly.

**Luigi**

+ Grounded Side-B always misfires if fully charged.
+ Side-B now takes longer to apply gravity to Luigi after it ends, aiding in horizontal recovery. (Ground)Side-B(3) Asychronous Timer 24 -> 2.

**Mario**

**Marth**

= Alternate costumes given different sword trail colors, per Achilles' code.

**Mewtwo**

+ Side-B now changes projectile ownership, making it actually function as a reflector.
+ Tail hurtboxes removed.

**Mr. Game & Watch**

+ Fixed a bug where B-Air, N-Air and U-Air were all unable to be L-cancelled.
+ Shield size increased from 10.75 to 15 units.
+ Mr. Game & Watch can now hold the B button to continue firing sausages with Neutral-B.
= Side-B now uses rightmost digit of damage percentage for its value. If it is 0, the outcome is random.
+ Down-B now fills up based on the amount of damage dealt by the absorbed projectile. If the projectile deals 1-8 damage, 1 unit is filled. If the projectile deals 9-12 damage, 2 units are filled. Anything beyond fills 3 units.

**Ness**

+ Neutral-B no longer puts Ness into freefall when used in midair.
+ Up-B projectile no longer disappears upon being hit or dying. It also no longer disappears when hitting another projectile. Ness is able to use Up-B one additional time if he hits a wall during the tackle portion of Up-B.

**Peach**

= F-Smash weapon is now dependent on the angle input. Up-angled F-Smash uses the pan, Down-angled F-Smash uses the golf club, and neutral F-Smash uses the tennis racket.
+ Side-B now interacts properly with shields.

**Pichu**

+ F-Tilt given increased knockback and electrical properties. Launch angles adjusted to increase potency.
