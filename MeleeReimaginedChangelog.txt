***General***

Note: Many of these mechanics are also present in SD Remix. The most beneficial have been implemented into the base game here.

= Set default bootup settings to tournament settings (4 stock, time limit, etc.).
~ Implemented Universal Controller Fix.
+ Restored v1.00 hitlag behavior (allows certain multihits to work properly).
= Taunt cancelling added (momentum maintained when taunting, cancelled by edge).
= Automatic L-cancelling added (removal of an uninteresting mechanic).
= Ledge invincibility attrition added (limits ledge stalling).
= Wall bracing added (removes wall infinites).
= Grab infinites removed.
~ Throw bug fixed (first frame of hitstun is never skipped).
~ Freeze glitch fixed (Ice Climbers Side-B bug).
~ Invisible ceiling glitch fixed.
~ Detection bubbles continue hurtbox collision check (Falcon/Ganon Side-B no longer phases through projectiles).
+ Universalized jumpsquat to 3 frames for all characters.
+ Removed phantom hits.
+ Removed meteor cancelling.
= Added Brawl/Smash 4-style airdodges that can be activated with the L button. R performs the Melee-style airdodge.
+ Implemented Brawl/Smash 4/Ultimate bury mechanics wherein strong hits remove opponents from the buried state.
+ Implemented Ultimate's Perfect Shield/Parry mechanic.

***Characters***

Note: Characters organized by placement on the most recent official Melee tier list (2021).

**Fox**

- U-Smash now has less base knockback (30 -> 26), knockback growth (112 -> 108), and damage (18% -> 17%). Mirrors PAL changes.
+ Neutral-B can now be held to continue firing lasers rather than requiring repeated inputs.

**Marth**

= Alternate costumes given different sword trail colors, per Achilles' code.
+ D-Air ending lag reduced (IASA 80 -> 60).

**Jigglypuff**

- Weight reduced (60 -> 58).
+ U-Smash hitbox IDs changed to allow the sweetspot to actually hit. Sweetspot given slightly boosted knockback growth (110 -> 115).
- B-Air disjoint reduced slightly (Z-Offset of outer hitbox 500 -> 300).
+ Up-B hits last for slightly longer (frame data matches Ultimate: first two hits have 9 active frames while the third has 15).

**Falco**

- D-Air late hit now sends away (Angle 290 -> 361), but unlike PAL the clean hit lasts longer (10 frames -> 12 frames) and the late hit time window is shorter (10 frames -> 8 frames).
+ Neutral-B can now be held to continue firing lasers rather than requiring repeated inputs.
+ Down-B hitbox size increased slightly (1536 -> 1648).

**Sheik**

- F-Air now sends at a slightly higher angle (25 -> 40).
+ Neutral-B charges are no longer lost if hit out of Side-B.
+ Up-B now allows for greater aerial movement during vanishing portion of the attack.
+ Down-B now allows Sheik and Zelda to swap almost laglessly.

**Captain Falcon**

+ Multijab removed, making gentleman execution much simpler.
+ U-Air collisions terminate 2 frames later, allowing Captain Falcon to hit the "tipman" hitbox at the end of the move.
+ Side-B now snaps to ledge. When hit in the air, aerial Side-B also gives Captain Falcon greater control afterwards. Aerial Side-B now enters fall instead of fall special after finishing.
+ Up-B can now be B-reversed by holding the control stick in the opposite direction.
+ Down-B now loses no speed instead of slowing down on contact with opponents. Knockback growth of all hitboxes except landing hitboxes increased by 10. Ending lag reduced via a 1.9 frame speed modifier to all ending animations.

**Peach**

= F-Smash weapon is now dependent on the angle input. Up-angled F-Smash uses the pan, Down-angled F-Smash uses the golf club, and neutral F-Smash uses the tennis racket.
+ Side-B now interacts properly with shields.

**Ice Climbers**

= Added a HUD element for Nana's damage percentage.
+ Implemented a bug fix for Nana's directional inputs.
+ Both climbers can now share the ledge.
+ Side-B can now gain height by holding the button rather than mashing.
+ Up-B used by just Popo now gives additional height.

**Pikachu**

+ U-Air damage increased on all hitboxes (4 -> 6).

**Yoshi**

+ Dash-Grab hitbox offset changed to make the move functional.
+ Up-B given increased control and momentum akin to Smash 4 and onwards.

**Samus**

+ Neutral-B charge is no longer lost when hit out of Up-B.

**Luigi**

+ Dash-Attack now has a finisher hit (Base knockback 2 -> 25, Damage 2 -> 8) and all non-finishing hits have a set knockback of 5.
+ Side-B always misfires if fully charged when grounded. A frame speed modifier of 2 is applied to Aerial Side-B to functionally reduce its ending lag and aid in Luigi's recovery. Aerial Side-B also takes longer to apply gravity to Luigi after it ends ((Ground)Side-B(3) Asynchronous Timer 24 -> 2).

**Dr. Mario**

+ Weight increased (100 -> 102).
+ Change D-Tilt

**Ganondorf**

+ U-Tilt speed increased. All hitbox sizes increased by 100. Angle adjusted to send upwards (361 -> 80). Power reduced as a tradeoff for speed (Base knockback 110 -> 50, Damage 27% -> 18%), but breaks shields instantly now (Shield damage 0 -> 100). Frame speed modifier of 2.1 applied.
$ U-Smash decloned into an uppercut move (reuses U-Throw animation). Move is rather powerful with the sweetspot at Ganondorf's fist.
+ N-Air now properly links the first hit into the second. Hitbox sizes for sweetspot increased slightly (900 -> 1200). Foot sweetspot does slightly more damage (12% -> 13%).
+ Neutral-B now allows Ganondorf to float for a short while. Uses the Ganon Float code by UnclePunch.
+ Side-B now snaps to ledge. It now sends opponents straight down when used on the ground (usually setting up a tech chase scenario), akin to Flame Choke, allowing for some followups. The aerial version also meteors opponents, and also has its landing lag frames on a successful hit reduced (40 -> 10). Ganondorf descends quicker after the move ends (Miss Gravity 0.05 -> 0.55).

**Mario**

**Donkey Kong**

+ Tie hurtbox removed.
+ Shield size increased (17.5 -> 19.5).
$ Dash-Attack changed to a quick bumping move to give DK a much better burst movement option. Reuses quick ledge getup attack animation.
+ Neutral-B charge is no longer lost when hit out of Up-B. Neutral-B also no longer puts DK into freefall when used in midair.
+ Down-B can be extended by just holding the B button instead of mashing.

**Young Link**

+ Neutral-B now travels faster and farther by default (Uncharged arrow velocity multiplier 1.3 -> 3.1, Charged arrow velocity multiplier 5 -> 6.2, Arrow weight 1.22 -> 0.36). A frame speed modifier of 1.45 is applied to charge and fire to speed up the attack. A frame speed modifier of 1.95 is applied at the end to reduce ending lag. Arrow base knockback increased (45 -> 60) but growth decreased (30 -> 20). Damaged increased (1% -> 3%).

**Link**

- N-Air collisions terminated properly.

**Mr. Game & Watch**

+ Fixed a bug where B-Air, N-Air and U-Air were all unable to be L-cancelled.
+ Weight increased (60 -> 62).
+ Shield size increased (10.75 -> 15).
+ Neutral-B can now be held to fire a burst of a few sausages consecutively.
= Side-B now uses rightmost digit of damage percentage for its value. If it is 0, the outcome is random.
+ Up-B can now be angled more horizontally (Maximum angle (radians) 0.524 -> 0.836).
= Down-B now fills up based on the amount of damage dealt by the absorbed projectile. If the projectile deals 1-8 damage, 1 unit is filled. If the projectile deals 9-12 damage, 2 units are filled. Anything beyond fills 3 units.

**Mewtwo**

+ Tail hurtboxes removed.
+ Side-B now changes projectile ownership, making it actually function as a reflector.

**Roy**

+ Maximum aerial horizontal velocity increased (0.9 -> 0.96).
$ Jab decloned into an upwards sword slash that mimics his Ultimate jab. Reuses the high animation for the second hit of Side-B. Move has weight-independent set knockback and is primarily a combo tool.
+ Dash-Attack active frames edited to match the animation (12-16 -> 13-20).
$ F-Tilt decloned into a horizontal sword swipe that reuses the middle animation for the third hit of Side-B. Ending lag reduced.
$ F-Smash decloned into an brutish overhead sword bash that reuses the high animation for the fourth hit of Side-B. Fire properties given to sweetspots. Ending lag reduced.
+ N-Air sweetspots for first hit given set knockback (Knockback growth 40 -> 0) and increased damage (4% -> 5%). Second hit sweetspots given increased damage (8% -> 9%), increased knockback growth (80 -> 85), and fire effect.
+ F-Air sweetspots given increased damage (8% -> 14%) and increased knockback growth (70 -> 85). Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 30 -> 24, IASA 35 -> 29).
+ U-Air sweetspots given increased damage (9% -> 12%), increased base knockback (20 -> 35), and increased knockback growth (70 -> 85). Hitboxes are active for 2 additional frames at the end. Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 30 -> 26, IASA 49 -> 36).
+ D-Air ending lag reduced (Autocancel 55 -> 34, IASA 64 -> 46). Sword sweetspot angle adjusted (361 -> 270). Damage of sweetspot hitboxes increased (9% -> 12%).
+ Up-B gives Roy much more horizontal movement in the air (Max horizontal air movement 0.6 -> 1.7) and the aerial version gets more vertical distance (Aerial jump height ratio 1.1 -> 1.24).

**Pichu**

+ F-Tilt foot sweetspots given increased knockback and electrical properties (Base Knockback 10 -> 20, Knockback Growth 100 -> 110). Launch angles adjusted to increase potency (Middle-Angled 361 -> 30, Low-Angled 361 -> 340).
+ D-Air launch angle for sweetspot adjusted to be a spike (Angle 361 -> 270). Knockback growth of sweetspot slightly increased (100 -> 120).
+ Down-B acts similarly to its Ultimate incarnation. Thunder bolt spikes opponents (Angle 94 -> 270) while Pichu's body hitbox launches outwards (Angle 361 -> 35). End lag reduced via a frame speed modifier of 2.1 for the looping and ending portion of the attack.

**Ness**

+ F-Air initial hits given set knockback to lead into finisher hit. Finisher hit given slightly increased knockback. Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 30 -> 20, IASA 40 -> 28).
+ Neutral-B no longer puts Ness into freefall when used in midair.
+ Up-B projectile no longer disappears upon being hit or dying. It also no longer disappears when hitting another projectile. Ness also has more control over the projectile (PKT turning control 0.5 -> 0.3, PKT turning radius 6 -> 8). Ness is able to use Up-B one additional time if he hits a wall during the tackle portion of Up-B.

**Zelda**

+ Side-B no longer puts Zelda into freefall when used in midair.
+ Down-B now allows Sheik and Zelda to swap almost laglessly.

+ Throws are no longer escapable. Additionally, Kirby can now jump after using any of his throws.
+ Dash-Attack no longer falls off ledges.
+ F-Tilt disjoint increased slightly.
+ D-Tilt ending lag reduced (IASA 30 -> 17).
+ N-Air fixed to allow hitting the strong hitbox at the beginning of the move, which lasts for 5 frames. Hitbox size increased slightly. Ending lag reduced (IASA 50 -> 42). Startup is reduced via a frame speed modifier of 1.14.
+ F-Air disjoint increased. First two hits now have set knockback to increase linkage between all hits. Ending lag reducced (Autocancel 38 -> 32, IASA 40 -> 34).
