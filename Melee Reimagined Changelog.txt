= Set default bootup settings to tournament settings (4 stock, time limit, etc.).
~ Implemented Universal Controller Fix.
+ Restored v1.00 hitlag behavior (allows certain multihits to work properly).
= Taunt cancelling added (momentum maintained when taunting, cancelled by edge).
= Automatic L-cancelling added (removal of an uninteresting mechanic).
= Ledge invincibility attrition added (limits ledge stalling).
= Wall bracing added (removes wall infinites).
= Grab infinites removed.
~ Throw bug fixed (first frame of hitstun is never skipped).
~ Freeze glitch fixed (Ice Climbers Side-B bug).
~ Invisible ceiling glitch fixed.
~ Detection bubbles continue hurtbox collision check (Falcon/Ganon Side-B no longer phases through projectiles).
+ Universalized jumpsquat to 3 frames for all characters.
+ Implemented the hurtbox priority fix for phantom hits.
+ Removed meteor cancelling.
+ Implemented Brawl/Smash 4/Ultimate bury mechanics wherein strong hits remove opponents from the buried state.

***Characters***

Note: Characters organized by placement on the most recent official Melee tier list (2021).

**Fox**

- U-Smash now has less base knockback (30 -> 26), knockback growth (112 -> 108), and damage (18% -> 17%). Mirrors PAL changes.
+ Neutral-B can now be held to continue firing lasers rather than requiring repeated inputs.

**Marth**

= Alternate costumes given different sword trail colors, per Achilles' code.
+ D-Air ending lag reduced (IASA 80 -> 60).

**Jigglypuff**

- Weight reduced (60 -> 58).
+ U-Smash hitbox IDs changed to allow the sweetspot to actually hit. Sweetspot given slightly boosted knockback growth (110 -> 115).
- B-Air disjoint reduced slightly (Z-Offset of outer hitbox 500 -> 300).
+ Up-B hits last for slightly longer (frame data matches Ultimate: first two hits have 9 active frames while the third has 15).

**Falco**

- D-Air late hit now sends away (Angle 290 -> 361), but unlike PAL the clean hit lasts longer (10 frames -> 12 frames) and the late hit time window is shorter (10 frames -> 8 frames).
+ Neutral-B can now be held to continue firing lasers rather than requiring repeated inputs.
+ Down-B hitbox size increased slightly (1536 -> 1648).

**Sheik**

- F-Air now sends at a slightly higher angle (25 -> 40).
+ Neutral-B charges are no longer lost if hit out of Side-B.
+ Up-B now allows for greater aerial movement during vanishing portion of the attack.
+ Down-B now allows Sheik and Zelda to swap almost laglessly.

**Captain Falcon**

+ Multijab removed, making gentleman execution much simpler.
+ U-Air collisions terminate 2 frames later, allowing Captain Falcon to hit the "tipman" hitbox at the end of the move.
+ Side-B now snaps to ledge. When hit in the air, aerial Side-B also gives Captain Falcon greater control afterwards. Aerial Side-B now enters fall instead of fall special after finishing, allowing Captain Falcon to use Up-B afterwards.
+ Up-B can now be B-reversed by holding the control stick in the opposite direction.
+ Down-B now loses no speed instead of slowing down on contact with opponents. Knockback growth of all hitboxes except landing hitboxes increased by 10. Ending lag reduced via a 1.9 frame speed modifier to all ending animations.

**Peach**

= F-Smash weapon is now dependent on the angle input. Up-angled F-Smash uses the pan, Down-angled F-Smash uses the golf club, and neutral F-Smash uses the tennis racket.
+ Side-B now interacts properly with shields.

**Ice Climbers**

= Added a HUD element for Nana's damage percentage.
+ Implemented a bug fix for Nana's directional inputs.
+ Both climbers can now share the ledge.
+ Up-B used by just Popo now gives additional height.

**Pikachu**

+ U-Air damage increased on all hitboxes (4 -> 6).

**Yoshi**

+ Dash-Grab hitbox offset changed to make the move functional.
+ Up-B given increased control and momentum akin to Smash 4 and onwards.

**Samus**

+ Neutral-B charge is no longer lost when hit out of Up-B.

**Luigi**

+ Dash-Attack now has a finisher hit (Base knockback 2 -> 25, Damage 2 -> 8) and all non-finishing hits have a set knockback of 5.
+ Side-B always misfires if fully charged when grounded. A frame speed modifier of 2 is applied to Aerial Side-B to functionally reduce its ending lag and aid in Luigi's recovery. Aerial Side-B also takes longer to apply gravity to Luigi after it ends ((Ground)Side-B(3) Asynchronous Timer 24 -> 2).

**Dr. Mario**

+ Weight increased (100 -> 102).
$ Jab 3 altered to a clobbering overhead swipe (reuses forward light item throw animation). Jab hits given ice, fire and electric properties as a reference to Dr. Mario pill colors.
$ D-Tilt is now a kick (reuses Jab 3 animation). Sweetspot has electrical properties and the move launches outwards (Angle 150 -> 55).

**Ganondorf**

+ Initial Dash speed increased (1.3 -> 1.35).
+ Grab & Dash-Grab range increased (Hitbox ID 0 size 1000 -> 1100).
+ Dash-Attack hitboxes now always cover Ganondorf's shoulder.
+ F-Tilt is now a backport of Brawl/S4/Ultimate's. Can still be angled.
+ U-Tilt hitboxes now match explosion graphic (hits below Ganondorf's foot). Shield damage significantly increased.
$ F-Smash is now a backport of Ultimate's.
$ U-Smash is now a backport of Ultimate's.
$ D-Smash is now a backport of Ultimate's.
+ N-Air now properly links the first hit into the second, as the first kick's hitboxes now last 6 frames instead of 2 and have set knockback (Weight Dependent Set Knockback 0 -> 60 for first hit, Autocancel 27 -> 30, IASA 46 -> 43). 
+ D-Air landing lag reduced (35 -> 32 frames).
+ Neutral-B now allows Ganondorf to float for a short while. Uses the Ganon Float code by UnclePunch.
+ Side-B now snaps to ledge. Aerial Side-B now enters fall instead of fall special after finishing, allowing Ganondorf to use Up-B afterwards. Aerial Side-B has its lowest detection bubble raised a bit to prevent the attack not connecting properly. A successful aerial hit gives Ganondorf a vertical boost. It now sends opponents straight down when used (usually setting up a tech chase scenario), akin to Flame Choke, allowing for some followups (Damage 17% -> 19%, Angle 105 -> 270). 
+ Up-B hitboxes modified to only have one large hitbox as opposed to two smaller ones. Horizontal momentum increased (0.85 -> 0.97).
+ Down-B hitboxes adjusted to match the visual effects more closely (moved to Ganondorf's actual foot).

**Mario**

**Donkey Kong**

+ Tie hurtbox removed.
+ Shield size increased (17.5 -> 19.5).
$ Dash-Attack changed to a quick bumping move to give DK a much better burst movement option. Reuses quick ledge getup attack animation.
+ F-Air autocancel moved to before the attack's IASA frame, allowing the move to actually be autocanceled (synchronous timer on frame 55 turned into asynchronous timer).
+ Neutral-B charge is no longer lost when hit out of Up-B. Neutral-B also no longer puts DK into freefall when used in midair.
+ Down-B can be extended by just holding the B button instead of mashing.

**Young Link**

+ Neutral-B now travels faster and farther by default (Uncharged arrow velocity multiplier 1.3 -> 3.1, Charged arrow velocity multiplier 5 -> 6.2, Arrow weight 1.22 -> 0.36). A frame speed modifier of 1.45 is applied to charge and fire to speed up the attack. A frame speed modifier of 1.95 is applied at the end to reduce ending lag. Arrow base knockback increased (45 -> 60) but growth decreased (30 -> 20). Damaged increased (1% -> 3%).

**Link**

- N-Air collisions terminated properly.

**Mr. Game & Watch**

+ Fixed a bug where B-Air, N-Air and U-Air were all unable to be L-cancelled.
+ Weight increased (60 -> 62).
+ Shield size increased (10.75 -> 15).
+ Neutral-B can now be held to fire a burst of a few sausages consecutively.
= Side-B now uses rightmost digit of damage percentage for its value. If it is 0, the outcome is random.
+ Up-B can now be angled more horizontally (Maximum angle (radians) 0.524 -> 0.836).
= Down-B now fills up based on the amount of damage dealt by the absorbed projectile. If the projectile deals 1-8 damage, 1 unit is filled. If the projectile deals 9-12 damage, 2 units are filled. Anything beyond fills 3 units.

**Mewtwo**

+ Tail hurtboxes removed.
+ Side-B now changes projectile ownership, making it actually function as a reflector. Landing lag reduced (Unsure what this value is 50 -> 20)? Frame speed modifier of 1.28 applied. A fix is implemented such that the move is no longer negative on hit for Mewtwo and works correctly. Side-B throw always has a set knockback of 80 and meteors opponents (Angle 280 -> 270). Opponents can tech when they are slammed to the ground, but if the tech is missed then the opponent is knocked down. Mewtwo now gains considerable followup potential from successfully hitting the move.

**Roy**

+ Maximum aerial horizontal velocity increased (0.9 -> 0.96).
$ Jab decloned into an upwards sword slash that mimics his Ultimate jab. Reuses the high animation for the second hit of Side-B. Move has weight-independent set knockback and is primarily a combo tool.
+ Dash-Attack active frames edited to match the animation (12-16 -> 13-20).
$ F-Tilt decloned into a horizontal sword swipe that reuses the middle animation for the third hit of Side-B. Ending lag reduced.
$ F-Smash decloned into an brutish overhead sword bash that reuses the high animation for the fourth hit of Side-B. Fire properties given to sweetspots. Ending lag reduced.
+ N-Air sweetspots for first hit given set knockback (Knockback growth 40 -> 0) and increased damage (4% -> 5%). Second hit sweetspots given increased damage (8% -> 9%), increased knockback growth (80 -> 85), and fire effect.
+ F-Air sweetspots given increased damage (8% -> 14%) and increased knockback growth (70 -> 85). Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 30 -> 24, IASA 35 -> 29).
+ U-Air sweetspots given increased damage (9% -> 12%), increased base knockback (20 -> 35), and increased knockback growth (70 -> 85). Hitboxes are active for 2 additional frames at the end. Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 30 -> 26, IASA 49 -> 36).
+ D-Air ending lag reduced (Autocancel 55 -> 34, IASA 64 -> 46). Sword sweetspot angle adjusted (361 -> 270). Damage of sweetspot hitboxes increased (9% -> 12%).
+ Up-B gives Roy much more horizontal movement in the air (Max horizontal air movement 0.6 -> 1.7) and the aerial version gets more vertical distance (Aerial jump height ratio 1.1 -> 1.24).

**Pichu**

+ F-Tilt foot sweetspots given increased knockback and electrical properties (Base Knockback 10 -> 20, Knockback Growth 100 -> 110). Launch angles adjusted to increase potency (Middle-Angled 361 -> 30, Low-Angled 361 -> 340).
+ D-Air launch angle for sweetspot adjusted to be a spike (Angle 361 -> 270). Knockback growth of sweetspot slightly increased (100 -> 120).
+ Neutral-B now does more damage (10% -> 13%) and has more base knockback (50 -> 80), but lower knockback growth (30 -> 10). Launch angle of the projectile changed (361 -> 75). Projectile now emerges at a lower angle than Pikachu's in the air (Aerial jolt angle -0.69 -> -1.02), has a higher lifetime (100 -> 120), and has higher aerial velocity (1.5 -> 2.24). Frame speed modifier of 1.54 applied to reduce lag.
+ Up-B has a frame speed modifier of 1.42 to quicken the move.
+ Down-B acts similarly to its Ultimate incarnation. The thunderbolt spikes opponents (Angle 94 -> 270) while Pichu's body hitbox launches outwards (Angle 361 -> 35). End lag reduced via a frame speed modifier of 2.1 for the looping and ending portion of the attack.

**Ness**

+ F-Air initial hits given set knockback to lead into finisher hit. Finisher hit given slightly increased knockback. Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 30 -> 20, IASA 40 -> 28).
+ Neutral-B no longer puts Ness into freefall when used in midair.
+ Up-B projectile no longer disappears upon being hit or dying. It also no longer disappears when hitting another projectile. Ness also has more control over the projectile (PKT turning control 0.5 -> 0.3, PKT turning radius 6 -> 8). Ness is able to use Up-B one additional time if he hits a wall during the tackle portion of Up-B.

**Zelda**

+ Grab startup decreased significantly (Frame 11 -> 7).
+ D-Air hitboxes given a knockback buff (10 -> 25 for sweetspot, 0 -> 15 for sourspot). Sweetspot and sourspot locations swapped (sweetspot is at the tip of Zelda's foot). Sweetspot given electrical properties and the same sound effect as the sweetspot for Zelda's F-Air and B-Air.
+ Side-B no longer puts Zelda into freefall when used in midair.
+ Down-B now allows Sheik and Zelda to swap almost laglessly.

**Kirby**

+ Taunting without an ability now grants a random ability. Taunting also has an applied frame speed modifier of 2.5 to hasten obtaining or ejecting ability.
+ Aerial drift increased (Max Aerial H Velocity 0.78 -> 0.84).
+ Throws are no longer escapable. Additionally, Kirby can now jump after using any of his throws.
+ Dash-Attack no longer falls off ledges.
+ F-Tilt disjoint increased slightly.
+ D-Tilt ending lag reduced (IASA 30 -> 17).
+ N-Air fixed to allow hitting the strong hitbox at the beginning of the move, which lasts for 5 frames. Hitbox size increased slightly. Ending lag reduced (IASA 50 -> 42). Startup is reduced via a frame speed modifier of 1.14.
+ F-Air disjoint increased. First two hits now have set knockback to increase linkage between all hits. Ending lag reducced (Autocancel 38 -> 32, IASA 40 -> 34).
+ B-Air disjoint increased. Sweetspot now lasts 4 additional frames and has base knockback increased (10 -> 11) and a better angle (361 -> 35). Sourspot late hit has base knockback increased (0 -> 5). Ending lag reduced (Autocancel 28 -> 25, IASA 36 -> 30).
+ U-Air hitbox size increased (1107 -> 1220). Ending lag reduced (IASA 36 -> 27).

+ Neutral-B copy abilities that can be charged no longer lose their charge when Kirby is hit out of other special moves.
+ Up-B now allows Kirby to drift horizontally significantly more than before (Maximum horizontal velocity forward 8 -> 80). Beginning hitbox now changed to be one big hitbox that launches at a 90 degree angle, descending hitbox increased in size slightly and given an angle of 270. Falling hitbox also no longer has set knockback. Frame speed modifier of 1.5 applied to the beginning of the move to make it begin faster.

**Bowser**

+ Flame Cancel ability restored to v1.00 state.
+ Grab and Dash-Grab range substantially increased.
