***Disclaimer***

This project is built off of PKFreeZZy's Melee Revision 3 mod, an existing balance/bugfix mod.
The aim of this project is to provide a mod that emulates what Melee may have been like if it received continuous updates and balance patches ala Ultimate.
In doing this, Melee Reimagined seeks to rebalance characters to bring the tiers closer together. Top tier characters will receive less changes in general, and meta shifts are welcomed as part of this process.
This mod does not necessarily seek to keep the characters in the same position relative to each other; some balance changes may be controversial, but no elements that are core to the identity of Melee have been changed.
This mod is also relatively competitively-oriented, though using Revision 3 as a base means that some fixes are implemented for casual play.

***Legend***

BKB: Base knockback, the default knockback unit, before formula variables are applied
KBG: Knockback growth, modifies how much knockback scales with damage
WDSK: Weight-Dependent Set Knockback, if greater than 0 this attribute will make knockback calculation ignore damage (stacks with base knockback and knockback growth). This means the move will deal the same amount of knockback regardless of the hitbox or the target's damage, but will factor in the target's weight.
Hitlag: Frames of temporary 'freeze' upon receiving or landing a hit.
Hitstun: Frames of helplessness after receiving damage.
DI: Directional Influence. As a victim, holding a direction on the control stick while in hitlag alters launch trajectory by up to 20 or -20 degrees.
SDI: Smash Directional Influence. As a victim, while in hitlag, mashing the control stick so that the difference between each input is 0.7 units of range moves the character in the direction specified per stick input.
ASDI: Automatic Smash Directional Influence. As a victim, if holding the control stick or C-Stick in a direction before entering hitlag, the character moves in the direction specified upon receiving the first freeze frame; half distance is gained compared to normal SDI.
IASA: 'Interuptible As Soon As', refers to the first actionable and/or interruptible frame of a move.
Auto-Cancel: A flag used to transition aerial attacks into the universal landing state with interruptible lag.
Sakurai Angle: A special hitbox angle which varies depending on the knockback of the attack and whether the victim is grounded or airborne. Usually launches at ~45 degrees.
Spike: Downward hitbox angle whose knockback cannot be cancelled with a jump or special move. All meteors are now spikes in Melee Reimagined.
Meteor Smash: A downward hitbox angle whose knockback can be cancelled after its first 8 frames of induced hitstun; a victim is locked into helplessness for 40 frames if an attempt to cancel was made before the 8th frame. Meteor smashes no longer exist in Melee Reimagined.
Sweetspot/Sourspot: Terms used to refer to a series of consequent hitboxes which are active at the same time but have different properties; the sweetspot is the stronger hitbox, while sourspots are weaker.
Clean Hit/Middle Hit/Late Hit: Terms used to a series of subsequent hitboxes in order of strength which are active independently of one-another; clean hits are usually stronger than middle or late hits.
Frame: The unit of measurement for game time; Melee runs at 60 frames per second.
Action State: The term used to refer to the current move the player is performing; action states may have various special properties.
Hitbox: A type of collision detection bubble that may inflict damage, knockback and/or status aliments on foes. They are colored red in DEVELOP mode.
Grab: A hitbox that traps opponents in a state which the attacker can follow up with special options. Most grab states can be mashed out of by rapidly making individual controller inputs. They are used by standing/dash grabs and some B moves. They are colored magenta in DEVELOP mode.
Reflection: Reflects projectiles with a damage multiplier of ~1.5x (special moves) or 0.5x (powershield), and colored turqoise in DEVELOP mode.
Absorption: The user 'catches' the projectile and repurposes it for their own use; colored soft blue in DEVELOP mode.
Detection: Searches foes and executes a subsequent action state when it finds one. It is used by Motion Sensor Bombs, Captain Falcon/Ganondorf's Side B and Peach's Side B, and hitboxes of this type are colored gray in DEVELOP mode.
Counter/Shield: A defensive hitbox type that either blocks attacks or detects incoming ones in a similar manner to the Detection hitbox type; colored cyan in DEVELOP mode.
Hurtbox: A type of collision detection bubble that can receive damage based on its collision state; in DEVELOP mode, these are colored yellow if vulnerable, deep blue if non-interactible (intangible), and green if invincible (can interact but will not receive damage).
ECB: Environmental Collision Box, A diamond-shaped object attached to entities which handles collision detection with stage elements.

***Mechanics***

- Jab reset requirements have been modified to requiring less than 7% damage and 60 knockback, eliminating the jab reset pop-up glitch.
- Port-priority influence reduced on grabs. Grab is now awarded to player with the greater grab hitbox overlap, and equal overlap resorts to port priority.
- Electric pummel effects now properly apply hitlag to opponents, and pummels now only impact the character being grabbed.
- Sing stalling has been removed.
- All throws can now be buffered with the C-Stick.
- V1.00 hitlag behavior restored, improving the performance of several multihit moves.
- Aerials are automatically L-cancelled - removes an arbitrary execution barrier.
- Ledge invincibility attrition - ledge grabs done in succession provide less invincibility.
- Wall bracing - wall infinites removed.
- Grab infinites removed.
- Infamous port-dependent throw bug with hitstun fixed.
- Detection bubble hurtbox check continues during Falcon/Ganon Side-B, so projectiles are no longer ignored.
- Shield graphics are preserved upon shield hitlag.
- Party balls, crates, and barrels can no longer be reflected.
- Capsules can now be reflected.
- Per-hit damage threshold increased from 500% to 999%.
- Fan, Lip's Stick and Star Rod are now reflectable.
- Ray Gun and Lip's Stick shots now have transcendent priority.
- Infinite super scope glitch fixed.
- Thrown Beam Sword now plays "Moderate Slash" SFX instead of "Weak Slash" on hit.
- Loose Hammer Head now has a larger hitbox and deals extra shield damage.
- Hammer no longer stales nor does it trigger the Stale Moves negative bonus; characters who squint while holding the hammer now always do so, rather than being exempt if picking up the hammer while airborne.
- Smash Attacks no longer experience lag upon release; animation updates immediately rather than stalling for one additional frame.
- HUD now becomes transparent if players are behind it.
- Menu descriptions no longer fail to update if menu options are switched too rapidly.
- Name Tags now render invisible alongside character models when applicable (i.e. Cloaking Device and Teleport Recoveries).
- Name Tags now update precisely with character position and no longer lag behind by one frame.
- Characters now switch to their "hurt" facial expressions on shield/reflector break, during thrown animations, and during Star KOs. Some characters also assume the "hurt" expression for ledge hanging.
- "Shield Static" GFX on shield damage no longer phases out when hit by attacks that induce too much shield stun.
- Many multihits now have the 367° Autolink Angle, which improves connectivity between the hits of a given move.

***Bugfixes***

- Invisible ceiling glitch fixed.
- Freeze glitch fixed.
- Soul breaker glitch fixed.
- Box glitch fixed.
- Samus Extender crash fixed.
- Break the Targets intangibility glitch fixed.
- Collision state parser bug fixed (ignoring hurtboxes with identical IDs).
- Cape teleport glitch fixed.
- Shield SDI movement glitch fixed.
- Phantom hit search loop fixed (may require more thorough testing).
- Name entry glitch fixed, preventing a wide variety of bugs such as playable Master Hand.

***Stages***

- Alternate music can now be activated by any controller port.
- Battlefield, Great Bay, and Jungle Japes:
	- Edges have been readjusted to prevent "Battlefielding".
- Corneria and Venom:
	- Arwing and Wolfen lasers now have transcendent priority.
- Dream Land 64: 
	- Platform textures have been fixed.
- Onett:
	- Awnings no longer fall from chain-type items and attacks (i.e. Hookshot, Yo-Yo, Chain).
- Kongo Jungle 64: 
	- The top left platform's angle is now identical to the top right platform.
- Pokémon Stadium:
	- Tree geometry in the fire transformation has been fixed to prevent falling through.

***Unlockables***

- KOs for unlockables are now calculated before the check for new unlockables is made.
- The Mario & Yoshi and Samus Unmasked trophies are now obtainable legitimately:
	- Mario & Yoshi requires 10,000 KOs in VS Mode with Mario and Yoshi combined (5,000 each minimum).
	- Samus Unmasked requires 10,000 KOs in VS Mode with Samus.
- Some trophies have been updated:
	- Tamagon's home series is now listed as "Devil World" instead of "Demon World".
	- Helirin is no longer misspelled as "Heririn".
	- Ho-Oh is no longer written as "Ho-oh".
	- On both Kirby Hat 1 and Kirby Hat 2, the visors for Samus and Captain Falcon have been darkened to match their in-game renders.
	- Meta Knight is no longer written as "Meta-Knight", and parts of the trophy have been recolored for accuracy.

***Items***

- The following projectiles no longer have their Y-velocity inverted upon reflection:
	- PK Fire
	- Thunder Jolt
	- Needle
	- Arrow
	- Ice Block
- All Pokémon that can be attacked no longer take damage from their owner, except Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet can now also be damaged by its owner's projectiles.
- Barrels are no longer "semi-intangible" while rolling, which originally prevented their owner's hits from registering.
